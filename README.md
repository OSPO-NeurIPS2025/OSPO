# OSPO
This repository contains the official implementation for the paper: **Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation**.


## About
**OSPO** is a self-improving prefernece optimization framework for compositional text-to-image generation, allowing an MLLM to improve its fine-grained image generation capability without needing any data or external model. 


## Setup
We provide conda configuration file to easily set up the environment.


## Inference
For inference, please download the weights from the following link:
- Janus-Pro-7B trained by **OSPO** Framework: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AI42LfljJ5nl2YZ-AVuD0sziYs0KB_yx/view?usp=sharing)


## Acknowledgement
We thank the authors of [Janus-Pro](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus?tab=readme-ov-file#janus-pro), for making their code available.


## TODO
- [ ] Release the OSPO framework code.
- [ ] Release the train dataset.
- [x] Release the model checkpoint.
- [ ] Release the inference code for text-to-image generation.
- [ ] Release the evaluation code.
