## About OSPO
**OSPO** is a self-improving prefernece optimization framework for compositional text-to-image generation, allowing an MLLM to improve its fine-grained image generation capability without needing any data or external model. 


## Setup
We provide conda configuration file to easily set up the environment.


## Inference
For inference, please download the weights from the following link:

## Acknowledgement
We thank the authors of [Janus-Pro](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus?tab=readme-ov-file#janus-pro), for making their code available.
